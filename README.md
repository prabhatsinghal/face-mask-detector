# face-mask-detector
i made a detector which can detect the faces wearing mask or not by using CNN model.
for this first i did some data preprocessing like converted bgr images to gray scale images and then resized it and after normalising i built a CNN model with having accuracy of around 93% on test dataset, and then opened a live camera for detecting faces in this i used cascade classifier to extract only face and resize it and then predicted it with the help of our built model.
USE: it can be used in places where wearing face mask is mandatory.
